This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in COBOL related to the MOD function's behavior with negative integers. The `bug.cob` file contains code that unexpectedly calculates the remainder.  `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version.  The core issue is that the standard MOD function may not behave as expected for negative input in all COBOL compilers, potentially resulting in inaccurate computations.
